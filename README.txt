------------------------

Developer Notes:
If Noobsploit freezes up, it may be installing an important DLL (EasyExploitsDLL.dll). 
Please wait until it is done installing/updating the dll before using the exploit.

If Noobsploit.exe doesnt launch, make sure you have the latest framework. If it still doesnt work, extract it to a new folder (ex: C:\Users\URNAME\Desktop\Noobsploit).
Make sure to disable your antivirus to prevent it deleting files (like EasyExploits.dll, EasyExploitsDLL.dll or Noobsploit.exe)

If Execute File doesnt work, make sure all dlls are updated and are installed. Also make sure your in a game with the exploit injected. If the DLLS have been deleted without your notice please disable your antivirus!

NOTE: If you find any bugs, DM Telamon#2533 where I can try to fix them.
